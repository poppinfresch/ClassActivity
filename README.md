Hi my name is Odette Popko
---
My background is in biology & animal science.
---
My career goals are to hopefully break into the fintech industry and collaborate with others to create a startup that pushes for more mainstream adoption for crypto.
---
I believe Fintech is the future and because coding is awesome, there's not very many women in the industry & its really a fascinating industry.
